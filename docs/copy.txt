===================================
DE1-SoC Asynchronous Communication
===================================
DE1-SoC Slave Communication Initialized
Using D0 (data) and D1 (clock) from Arduino D2/D3
Running in asynchronous bidirectional mode
JP1 direction register value: 0x00000000
JP1 data register value: 0xFFFFFFFF
Operating in automatic mode - no KEY press needed
KEY0 can still be used to manually trigger reception
