===================================
DE1-SoC UART Debug Test Started
===================================
JP1 UART initialized at 4800 baud
UART_RX_BIT = 0x00000400, UART_TX_BIT = 0x00000800
JP1 direction register value: 0x00000800
JP1 data register value: 0xFFFFFFFF
BIT_PERIOD = 20833 clock cycles
RX pin initial state: HIGH
Test Controls:
- KEY0: Send test message in current mode
- KEY1: Run TX pin toggle test
- KEY2: Run loopback test
- KEY3: Run direct pin loopback test
- Switch settings control test mode:
  SW0=0: Normal mode (short messages)
  SW0=1: Different test patterns
===================================

Test mode changed to: 0


KEY3 pressed - Running direct pin loopback test

===== DIRECT PIN LOOPBACK TEST =====
Testing direct connection between TX (0x00000800) and RX (0x00000400) pins
Initial state: TX pin is HIGH, RX pin is HIGH
TX HIGH test: TX pin set HIGH, RX pin is HIGH (following)
TX LOW test: TX pin set LOW, RX pin is LOW (following)

Rapid toggle test (TX HIGHΓåÆLOWΓåÆHIGH, checking RX after each change):
Toggle 1 HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Toggle 1 LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)
Toggle 2 HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Toggle 2 LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)
Toggle 3 HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Toggle 3 LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)
Toggle 4 HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Toggle 4 LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)
Toggle 5 HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Toggle 5 LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)

Testing input latching behavior:
Read 1 after TX HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Read 2 after TX HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Read 3 after TX HIGH: RX is HIGH (JP1=0xFFFFFFFF)
Read 1 after TX LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)
Read 2 after TX LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)
Read 3 after TX LOW: RX is LOW (JP1=0xFFFFF3FF)

Test Summary:
PASS: RX pin correctly follows TX pin (normal connection)
