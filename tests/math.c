Recommendations

Implementation Issues:

Fix weight initialization for better randomization
Add gradient clipping to prevent explosions
Increase learning rate decay or use a more aggressive schedule
Review the LeakyReLU implementation, as the weight statistics suggest it may not be working properly


Algorithm Improvements:

Reduce exploration rate more gradually
Add entropy regularization to discourage premature convergence to deterministic policy
Normalize observations more effectively
Consider increasing memory buffer size (currently 300 steps)



The code appears to be running on an embedded system with limited resources, but these adjustments should improve training stability and performance.
